# Parallax Effect
Parallax scrollingðŸ‘‡ is a web design technique that is used to enhance user experience. The idea behind the parallax effect is to create an illusion of depth as the background scrolls slower than the foreground. The different scrolling speed of the elements gives the 2DðŸ“ƒ scene an effect similar to 3DðŸ“¦.
